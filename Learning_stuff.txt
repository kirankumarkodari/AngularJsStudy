--> What is the difference between ng-bind and ng-model ? 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12419619/whats-the-difference-between-ng-model-and-ng-bind
Ans: ng-bind is only required where the value to display does not require user input. And, ng-modal would be used for values (<input>) that do. The angular documentation seems to suggest this but I'm after a better understanding.

     ng-bind: {{}}
     ng-model: Scope member variable which supports two way data binding this mainly uses for form inputs.
